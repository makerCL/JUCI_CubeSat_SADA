## CubeSat Solar Array Drive - Cal Poly Senior Project

This repository presents the development and proposed design of a deployable Solar Array Drive Assembly that could be flown on space-bound CubeSat missions. Our project addresses the need for reliable sources of power in spacecraft and other missions beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Our goal is to create a two degree of freedom SADA, including the passive retainment, deployment, and axial rotation of a solar array to track the sun during the CubeSatâ€™s orbit. It will have the ability to be easily adapted and integrated into other CubeSat builds but does not include other subsystems necessary for full satellite. The scope includes three main areas: the design and manufacture of a 90-degree locking hinge that allows multiple solar arrays to deploy from the stored launch state, the controlled axial rotation of the deployed panels, and the electronics necessary to manage these features with the potential for sun tracking algorithms.
